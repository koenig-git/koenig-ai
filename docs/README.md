Below you find snippets of code and knowledge that are stored for re-use in future projects. These bits of information come in extremely handy for me to avoid googling problems that I know I have solved before. 

The pages below are intended mainly for my personal use and I cannot guarantee functionality beyond that scope. That said, if you come across an error or have suggestions for the page, feel free to let me know.
